# Problem Statement ðŸŽ¯
Converting HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) documents to DOCX 
(Microsoft Word) format. While both formats serve different purposes, there are scenarios where it's necessary to 
convert HTML content into a more widely used and editable format like DOCX.

---
## Our Focus Areas:
âž¢ Preserving Formatting and Styles: Maintaining the original formatting, including fonts, colors, styles, and 
layouts, is crucial for the converted document to accurately represent the original HTML content.

âž¢ Dealing with Hyperlinks and References: Ensuring that hyperlinks, references, and cross-references within the 
HTML document are retained and functional in the resulting DOCX file.

âž¢ Supporting Complex HTML Structures: Robust handling of complex HTML structures, including nested 
elements, tables, lists, and CSS styles, is necessary for a reliable conversion process.

âž¢ Minimizing Data Loss: Minimizing the loss of information during the conversion process, such as special 
characters, non-standard fonts, and custom CSS styles.

âž¢ Scalability and Performance: The conversion tool should be capable of handling large or multiple HTML files 
efficiently without compromising on accuracy or speed.

---
## Implementation:
### Frontend:
We have created a user-friendly form using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. The form allows users to upload a file, which is then processed. Once the processing is complete, a downloadable DOCX file is generated. The combination of these technologies ensures a seamless and responsive user experience.

### Backend:
